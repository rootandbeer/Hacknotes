Difficulty: Medium

**Run [[nmap]] -A scan against all TCP ports:**

```bash
┌──(vagrant㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -p- -A 192.168.5.118

```

**Run [[gobuster]] with common file extension checks to discover "exploit.html":**

```bash
┌──(vagrant㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ gobuster dir -u http://192.168.5.118/ -e -r -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt -x html,htm,asp,aspx,jsp,php,cgi,txt,xml

```

**Browse to exploit.html & intercept request with Burpsuite. Note that the POST request changes the "Host" header to localhost; change this instead to the target wev server (in this case, 192.168.5.118) to receive the first portion of the flag:**

```
FLAG{N7
```

**Next: cheat & find the /enter\_network/ page by googling for a walkthrough. There doesn't appear to be any other feasible way to find this page..**

**Intercept POST request containing user/pass parameters via Burpsuite, & save this HTTP request to request.txt:**

```
POST /enter_network/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.5.118
Content-Length: 33
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept-Language: en-US

```

**Feed request.txt to sqlmap and attempt to determine database names, as follows:**

```bash
